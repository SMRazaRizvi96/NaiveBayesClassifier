# NaiveBayesClassifier

A Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign ‘class labels’ to ‘problem instances’ that are represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set.

In this project the weather dataset was used for Training and Testing, but the code can be easily used for any dataset.
